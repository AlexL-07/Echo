## Overview

[Echo](https://echo-cbwl.onrender.com) is my attempt at creating a clone of [Discord](https://discord.com), a VoIP and instant messaging social media platform with millions of worldwide users. Through Echo users can communicate with each other via chat messages in real-time, create servers and channels, add other users as friends, and also invite other people to their servers.

## Technologies 

To build Echo, I used a React-Redux frontend paired with a Ruby on Rails backend, and PostgreSQL as the database management system. For the general styling I used CSS and [MUI](https://mui.com/) for the icons. I also used Action Cable for the websocket connections to enable live updates for most of my CRUD features. 

## Features

Users can create their own servers and add as many channels as they like. Once they create servers and channels they can also edit or delete them. Users can send messages in these channels to talk with each other in real-time. They can also edit or delete their messages.

## Significant Code 

#### Invite Links

#### User Status Change 

## Other Visuals 

## Future Features
* Implement a notification system
* Allow group DMs
* Reactions for messages
* Server roles/moderation
* Voice calls
